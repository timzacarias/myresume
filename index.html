            <strong>Day-to-day Operations:</strong> <br>My responsibilities encompassed conducting troubleshooting of incidents, determining underlying causes, resolving issues, and meticulously documenting solutions while implementing preventive measures. I've been actively involved in collaborating with teams to introduce new cloud-based initiatives, delivering essential training when needed. Monitoring day-to-day activities and generating metric reports tailored to client requirements, including Tomcat Apache 8 services and Grafana Monitoring, have been key aspects of my role. Coordinating monthly OS patching activities and working in close coordination with teams such as the DBA Team have ensured that all environments remain compliant with security standards and up-to-date. Moreover, I have been responsible for developing, maintaining, and resolving alerts and support tickets. I was designated to oversee the monitoring and troubleshooting of Azure Kubernetes issues.
<br>        
            <br><strong>Projects:</strong> </br>spearheaded collaborative efforts to integrate Azure and AWS monitoring alerts into our ticketing system, enhancing alert management efficiency. I developed customized alert rules for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to proactively identify and resolve potential issues and executed AKS and Kubed upgrades for optimized system performance. Implementing an automated GxP server package deployment process streamlined compliance checks. I used PowerShell scripting to enhance resource management and orchestrated an automated reminder system in Microsoft Teams for improved team communication. Alongside these achievements, I conducted troubleshooting, introduced cloud-based initiatives, and ensured the compliance and security of our environments, all while maintaining meticulous documentation and resolving alerts and support tickets, including the monitoring and troubleshooting of Azure Kubernetes issues.  
<br>     
            <br><strong>Technical Operations:</strong> </br>As a key contributor to Technical Operations, I took on the role of orchestrating and leading technical project management, functioning as the Scrum Master for our Azure DevOps (ADO) initiatives. This involved ensuring efficient sprint planning, providing regular updates, and facilitating insightful retrospectives for continuous improvement. My meticulous approach extended to producing technical documentation for each project, capturing detailed specifications, configurations, and procedures to facilitate knowledge transfer and maintain accurate records. I also played a pivotal role in facilitating technical meetings, guiding discussions, and capturing essential information to drive collaborative decision-making. My responsibilities included meticulously documenting meeting minutes to capture action items and follow-ups. Additionally, I designed and implemented a customized PowerPoint template in alignment with technical branding guidelines, enhancing visual communication and consistency within our team's presentations.
